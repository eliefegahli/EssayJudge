#EssayJudge

EssayJudge is a website for anyone to upload example essays and have
them critiqued by a Professor of Literature with a PhD in English.
The content is great, but the backend of the site could use some work.

I take no responsibility for the poor state of the code,
as it was done by some very cheap foreign contractors. I took
the code to fix a few bugs, but a total re-write may be in order.

##Technical Stuff

Nothing too fancy going on in the backend. Just some terrible, terrible
PHP code, and a MySQL database.
